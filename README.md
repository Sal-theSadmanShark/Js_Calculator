# Js_Calculator

A calculator app made using javascript , html and css. It can add , substract , multiply , divide , find the remainder , do exponents and compare expressions . It uses a custom eval() function to evaluate almost all of the scenarios a real eval() function can do .

It took me roughly a day to write the js and another to style and sort the code . Use it however you want and pls inform me if you find any bugs . Thank you.
